User Story #211905: JQuery: Piano App
-------------------------------------

> - [x] Create a "piano" app to show the keystrokes for playing "Mary Had a Little
>       Lamb."
>
> - [x] It should draw 3 boxes on the screen, all white.
>
> - [x] Then it should make each one grey in the correct order to play the song.
>
> - [x] Each key should be "pressed" for 1 second.
>
> - [x] Be sure to turn the keys back white after the press is done.
>
> - [x] Assuming left key is 1, middle key is 2, and right key is 3, the song goes like
>       this:\
>       3-2-1-2-3-3-3-2-2-2-3-3-3, 3-2-1-2-3-3-3-3-2-2-3-2-1.
>
> - Remember, JavaScript and JQuery are asynchronous, so it's not as simple as just
>   changing the color of the keys one right after the other
> - I recommend you look into creative use of .setTimeout.
> - [x] Also, think about the fact that we need a brief moment between presses of the
>       same key so we can tell it was pressed.
